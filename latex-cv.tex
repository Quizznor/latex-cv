\section{About Me}

Everywhere I go, people come up to me and they ask me two questions. They say, “Duke, why are you great?”
Then they say, “Duke, where have you been all my life or, at least, the last decade of my life.” Today I
think it’s time to answer both those questions.

So here goes…

You know, I have a saying – with an enormous appendage comes great responsibility. The responsibility to
make sure no good babe goes unfurnished. There’s so many hotties, and so little time – so the Duke has to
prioritise.

But you know, life isn’t all about porking pretty ladies, no sir. There comes a time when the Duke has to
save the world – which I’ve done on numerous occasions. If my existence has proven anything it’s that every
single problem mankind has ever had, or ever will have in the future, can be solved by aiming a big ass
Rocket Launcher in its general direction.

You think it was all those nerds with their microscopes and lab coats that saved your sorry asses from the
Y2K bug? Hell no. I did what any self respecting man would do when a bug approaches – I stomped on that
little bastard, with copious amounts of ballistic weaponry. Y2K the King baby. Now hire me.
